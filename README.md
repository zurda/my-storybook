## My Storybook 

This is the second project in my #52Projects in 2020. 

The plan was to create a component library that includes the components used in my previous project. Once set up, these components will allow me to create new projects faster. 


## Lessons learned 

- Snapshots testing 
- Addons (accessibility- good. Source code - not so much )
- Releasing as package turned out to be problematic. After all, that means that with every addition to the library I'll need to republish and change the version of the package 
- Read about yarn link! 
- Different ways to set up the file tree
